# Heya ðŸ‘‹ I'm killian.

I'm a software developer/engineer enjoying programming since 2014. 
I enjoy working closely with JVM languages such as [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), 
as well as other native languages like [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

I develop multiple category of software, usually under the 
free/libre/open-source (FLOSS) philosophy which I like a lot.

I currently am working on a JVM injection-based [modding platform/framework](https://github.com/stardust-enterprises/atlas-framework), 
as well as a [hooking/transformation framework](https://github.com/stardust-enterprises/deface), 
also for the JVM.
