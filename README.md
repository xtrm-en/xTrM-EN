# Heya ðŸ‘‹ I'm xtrm.

I'm a software developer/engineer. I code in Java, Python and JavaScript, and I'm currently learning C++, Kotlin and x86 Assembly.

I develop open-source projects/software, such as a Minecraft modpack installer/updater, as well as other public projets, including a JVM injection-based modding platform soon to be published.
