# hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm **killian.**

`ðŸ’»` I'm a `19` y/o software developer having a blast at programming since `2014`.  
`ðŸ“š` I'm also a student @ [42 Angouleme](https://42angouleme.fr), a campus part of the wider [42 Network](https://www.42network.org/). 

## Where is everything???

I've begun the process of migrating **all** my repositories, organizations, and projects to [my Codeberg profile](https://codeberg.org/xtrm). 

## Why?

[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/about) is a democratic, community-driven, & non-profit software development platform and Git hosting. It is simply the better choice for me, both in terms of ethics and functionnality. also fuck microsoft lol.

## "Can I upload your projects on GitHub?"

[No, please.](https://nogithub.codeberg.page/)
