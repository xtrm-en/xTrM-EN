# Heya 👋 I'm `killian.`

`💻` I'm a software developer/engineer enjoying programming since 2014. 

`✨` I enjoy working closely with JVM languages such as [`Kotlin`](https://kotlinlang.org),
as well as other native languages, with [`Rust`](https://rust-lang.org) being one of my top choices.  
`✍️` I develop multiple category of software, usually under the
free/libre/open-source (FLOSS) philosophy which I like a lot.

`🌱` I currently am working on a JVM interoperable and injection-based [`modding platform/framework`](https://github.com/stardust-enterprises/atlas-framework), 
as well as a [`hooking framework`](https://github.com/MizuSoftware/aspekt) and a [`transformation library`](https://github.com/stardust-enterprises/deface), 
also for the JVM.
