# welcome here ðŸ‘‹, i'm X.

`ðŸ’»` I'm a `19` y/o software developer having a blast at programming since `2014`.  
`ðŸ“š` I'm also a student @ [42 Angouleme](https://42angouleme.fr), a campus part of the wider [42 Network](https://www.42network.org/). 

## Where is everything???

I've begun the process of migrating **all** my repositories, organizations, and projects to [my **Codeberg** account](https://codeberg.org/xtrm). 

## Why?

[**Codeberg**](https://codeberg.org/about) is simply the **better** choice for me, both in terms of ethics and functionnality. It is a **democratic**, **community-driven**, & **non-profit** software development platform and **Git hosting**, and has much more respectable standards when it comes to **user privacy**. also *fuck microsoft*.

## "Can I upload your projects on GitHub?"

[**No**, please.](https://nogithub.codeberg.page/)
